## Description
A low level program, developed using C++ Version 23 (C++ 23), it's a really low level implementation, as it uses no non-standard C++ libraries apart "windows.h" header for Windows API development, however it may use GDI under Window's interface, 
Program utilises the Windows's API (WIN32/WIN64) to display a window with two buttons that lead to either random colour action on background or open a child window.

### IDE, Compiler and other tools
<b>CLion IDE:</b> Written source code with it, built x64 release binary executable
<b>Visual Studio 2022 Community:</b> Profiling tools to fix memory leaks, instances monitoring and heap/stack analysing
<b>CMake:</b> Build tool for the program
<b>G++:</b> Compiler for program
